# Radio Golha Desktop Application

[Electron](https://electronjs.org/) is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In our case we'll be using React.

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is JavaScript library for building user interfaces... and so much more.

To make the React setup easier we're going to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Create React App (CRA) is awesome because it saves buckets-of-time and eliminates config hell.

Create React App is a tool (built by developers at Facebook) that gives you a massive head start when building React apps. It saves you from time-consuming setup and configuration. You simply run one command and Create React App sets up the tools you need to start your React project.

### Getting started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/espitman/cra-electron-kit.git

Then install all the `node_modules` needed by executing the following command:

```sh
